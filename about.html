                Hello! My name is Richard Montes, and I am a web developer who created this wonderful little webiste about me.
                Just some basic info to get you start like said my name is Richard Montes, I am 21 years old and I am curretly enrolled in Bates 
                Technical College for a certificate of training for sofetware develompment.
                I was at Tacoma Community College prior to Bates for a computer engineering degree but that did not work out for me so I switched.
                I was born and raised here in washington state, spectifically in Lakewood, WA. I am giant melting pot of cultures and ethnicities. 
                My father is from New Mexico but he is of Mexican and Spanish decent. My Mother is from Colorado but she is of Japanese and African American decent.
                Those are the main parts of me but there are so much more.
                I've always been interested in tech mostly in the physical hardware more from me wanting to play video games on a better PC but talking to my father, 
                it always seemed like a interesting thing to explore.
                Right now I am passionate on learning a lot so I can learn to make a video game myself. I've also been learning to play the guitar because I love
                to listen and try to play along to metal music.
            </p>

    
        <h2 class="current">My Most Recent Life</h2>

                taking trips. It's been an interesting 21 years of life.

                </figure>
                <p> As shown on this figure this is my lovely Fiance Bethany Vigil. Planned to be married June 2027. We have been together for about
                    4 years this november. We met when we where still both in highschool. She was one of the first poeple I talked to 
                    when I transferred from a private school to a public school. Then covid hit and we lost contact for a while, mainly 
                    my fault but after the hybrid school season ended we started talking to each other again and during the holloween season 
                    we hung out for a bit then she asked me out and we've been together since. Recently we got engaged last year in december at hawaii
                    during a family christmas vaction. She is my best friend and I love her so much. She is currently studying to get their PHd in biology.
                    She loves fish and aquariums. They particularly love whale sharks as they have a tattoo on their leg. They were gonna be a docter but decided
                    they love fish more.

                <p> Omar Ramos is what people would say as my best friend. We met during my first year of highschool after I transfered.
                    we had some classes together but the most important on was a class about something that I dont remember but we had shared
                    interest in the music made by Suicideboys and the TV show Invincible. We continued to talk during that class but the friendship
                    started when we both had a mutual friend named Destinie. After awhile of me sitting by myself I started sitting with Destinie and Bethany.
                    Then we lured Omar into our small little group with currios and we sat together for lunch pretty much everyday until we graduated.
                    We continued to stay in touch and hang out after highschool. We evidently went to the same college for a bit.

                    <figcaption>This is Jojo!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>I happen to meet Jojo in college at Tacoma Community College. I met her via Omar, which is pretty common wiht him because he it
                   pretty social and outgoing. I never noticed but we had the same class together, Intro to Coding. We got along pretty well and talked 
                   every now and then during the school year. She started to hang around with our group because she had mutal friends and started hanging 
                   becoming friends with Omar. I noticed that They started to get closer, I mean that's not unusual but at the beginning of the new quarter 
                   of school Omar told me they started dating. I was surprised but happy for him. They honestly make an amazing couple. Out of my own insecurities
                   I am not sure if she considers me a close friend but I would like to consider her as one as I do care for both of their wellbeings.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>This is Sam!</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Sam is a very close friend Bethany. She has known Bethany since I believe middle school. I got to know her when I started to date
                    Bethany. We hung out only a few times but when Bethany started their second year of college I got to know and get along more with 
                    Sam as she was her roommate. We would talk and joke around in their dorm room as I visited Bethany. Same with Jojo, I am not sure if she
                    considers me a close friend but I believe we do get along pretty well. She is a funny and sweet person. She works as a coach? for chidren gymnastics 
                    because she herself was a gymnast when she was younger i've heard. She is currently studying to be a nurse and is graduating next year. Ive 
                    definitely heard some horror stories about her clinicals and general studies but I believe she will do great in the future.
